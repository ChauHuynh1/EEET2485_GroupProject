I.	Introduction:
In this modern world, technology play an important role in making any objects to be smarter. In this project, our group will analysis a system called Room Occupancy Estimation. This system will create a standard for smart building in near future. This system will assist building managers or hotel managers to acknowledge number of rooms being used at the moment and number of rooms is currently empty. By using multiple sensors like temperature, lights, sound, CO2. With multiple devices being used in this system, IoT will be employed and most importantly, all these devices must be energy efficient and low cost. Therefore, these devices will need to be saving energy for less battery consuming. Moreover, our group is going to analyst data in this project, to see efficintcy of the system.
II Research Questions:
A. Analyse correlations betweeen each parameters:
    - correlation between temperature and CO2.
    - correlation between temperature and sound.
    - correlation between temperature and light.
    - correlation between CO2 and light.
    - correlation between CO2 and sound. 
    - correlation between sound and light. 
B. Analyse empty room condition:
    - what is the main factor that can be used and considered when the number of that factor pass a specefic number. 
    - what factors that often high when the room is empty.
    - what factors that often low when the room is empty. 
    - what factors can be paired to verify the room is empty. 
    - what factors can't be paired to verify the room is empty. 
    - what are other factors (beside temperature, CO2, sound, light) can make changes of number when the room is empty.  
C. Analyse occupy room condition: 
    - what is the main factor that can be used and considered when the number of that factor pass a specefic number. 
    - what factors that often high when the room is occupied.
    - what factors that often low when the room is occupied. 
    - what factors can be paired to verify the room is occupied. 
    - what factors can't be paired to verify the room is occupied. 
    - what are other factors (beside temperature, CO2, sound, light) can make changes of number when the room is empty.
